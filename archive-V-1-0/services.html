Messaging Playbook Create a solid foundation for your   marketing and sales, so you can focus on your core business, passion, excellence, and profitability. Good for beginners to advance marketers, a playbook lays it all out for you in a one master messaging document. It includes a customer analysis, core brand identity and sales tactics.

Monthly Article/Blogging Packages: Nurture the prospects who would otherwise slip away with consistent articles on your business blog, LinkedIn Pulse, Medium, industry publications, guest blogs on other sites, and more. Without having to write anything yourself.

Email Newsletters: Connect with your customers and prospects through email. It’s still one of the best ways to stay in touch and helps you build rapport with your list and close more sales. Increase your MRR and reduce monthly churn with a regular email newsletter for your tech business.
